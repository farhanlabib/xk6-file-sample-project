- "I got this error and I'm sure it's a bug" -- search the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues) to see if it was already reported and, if so, give the issue a :+1:. If it wasn't, [open a new issue](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues) and add a `bug` label. Make sure to specify your xk6-browser version, OS and OS version, browser version, and a small JS script with detailed steps of how to reproduce the issue.
